# opus

## Features

More of a text-editor in the sense that it simply reads local files and parses the markdown.

### Customizable
- Font: typeface, size, color, spacing
- Editor: editor colors, sidebar colors, icons (?)

Extensible -- use `styles/` folder with multiple css files to allow for multiple themes?

### File System
Stores notes in markdown as .md (or .txt?) files rather than hidden in some database system. Makes it easy to work with a folder system and programs like Dropbox.

Be able to specify a default folder from where files should be read, i.e:
`~/Documents/School/2018/` or `~/Dropbox/opus/`

### Editor


Support all features from Quill.js
